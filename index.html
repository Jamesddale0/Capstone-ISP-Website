                <div class= body_text>
                    <p> ISP stands for Internet Service Provider. Internet service providers are the gateway in allowing users access to the internet. Different geographical locations are covered by different ISP's. It is important to check your area in order to find out what ISP's are available in your area.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Just about every ISP will offer a number of different plans that will vary in Mbps, data caps, and cost. If possible, you should always shop around when seeking out the right ISP, as prices, can vary a bit depending on the choice. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    As a tip, Internet Service Providers will just about always try to bundle in a modem for rent with whatever plan you decide to purchase, these modems can set you back anywhere from $10-$20 each month. I would always suggest that you do your research and find a modem that is compatible with your ISP and buy your own instead of renting. It may be a larger cost up front, but, after 6-10 months, you will be glad you bought one instead of renting.

                <h1 class="body_header">How many Megabits are needed?</h1>
                    <div class= body_text>
                        <p> So, the million dollar question, how many mbps do I really need? This question is a very important one, it will would mean the difference between paying $30 per month or $70 per month. So, 10mbps? 50mbps? 100mbps? 500mbps? How much do you really need?  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        It is important to firstly understand how those Megabits are being used. Typically, a regular HD stream will use around 5mbps, while a 4K stream will use closer to 20mbps. For gamers, only about 3mbps is required to play games online. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When it comes to downloads, it is important to understand a tricky distinction. This distinction is between megaBITS and megaBYTES. While most downloads are recorded in megabytes, ISP's advertise in megabits. It is confusing, I know. So you are aware, there are 8 megabits in every megabyte. So if you purchase a plan that advertises 80 megabits per second, you can expect downloads around 10 megabytes per second.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The last variable to consider is the number of individuals that will be on the network at a single time. If for instance, if there are 4 individuals who are all streaming at the same time, 20mbps may not be enough to cover that.
                            I have found that, for myself and my wife, 100mbps is more than enough to support the two of us.

                <h1 class="body_header">Should I be concerned about data caps?</h1>
                    <div class= body_text>
                        <p> There is one last element that is easy to question when looking at different plans. That element is data caps. How much of a concern are data caps?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Today, there is a wide spectrum of data caps, anywhere from 50gb per month, to unlimited. This will also vary a great deal depending upon the ISP. When enough data is used up in a month, and a data cap is reached, the ISP can then greatly throttle your internet speeds until the next billing period. This being said, I do not consider data caps to be as serious of an issue as mbps.   
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        The truth is, most mid-range to high-end plans today will come with at least a terabyte data cap. This is a fairly high ceiling for most and will be hard to reach, unless there are frequent, constant downloads occurring on your network. In which case it may be worth seeking out a unlimited data cap.
